#### Open a spectrum

To open a spectrum, the Jcamp or NMRium file with the raw data must be dragged or copied and pasted from the computer into the workspace. To do this, the corresponding jcamp files are selected in the Explorer and dragged into the workspace with the left mouse button held down.

Alternatively the link to a jcamp file can be opened. On the left side of the workspace there is a bar with buttons. By clicking the third button from above and then clicking the text "Add jcamp from URL" a small window opens. In this window you can either insert the link to the corresponding file or enter it using the keyboard. Clicking the "Load" button in the small window opens the spectrum


#### switch between spectra 

You can switch between 1H and 13C spectra by clicking the corresponding icon. The Dept spectrum is located under the 13C button.
